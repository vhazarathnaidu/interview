IAM Policies
  IAM Policy defines the permissions which can be assigned to user or role or group
  AWS Provides built in policies and it also gives us the option to create custom policies.
  AWS IAM uses effective permissions by combining policies at group and user level
  When combined if there is a conflict between allow and deny, deny is always the winner.
