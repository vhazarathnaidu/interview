1. How do you make a subnet private?
  probably your subnet is using a vpc's main route table, which has the route to IGW. 
  In that case, 
    create a new route table (by default it will not have a route to IGW) and associate it with the new subnet. 
	This way your new subnet will use the new route table without IGW, and will be "private"

2. EC2 needs access to s3, how do you make sure EC2 has required permissions?	
   Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) profile role that grants access to Amazon S3
   Attach the IAM instance profile to the EC2 instance
   Permissions on the S3 bucket or use the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess or AmazonS3FullAccess managed IAM policy to allow EC2 access to all Amazon S3 buckets
   
3. VPC Gateway endpoints to Amazon S3   
   Gateway VPC endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without an internet gateway or NAT
   If private EC2 instance with connectivity to Amazon S3 with gateway virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint for Network connectivity between the EC2 instance and Amazon S3 
   Add it as a target in your route table for traffic destined from your VPC to Amazon S3.
